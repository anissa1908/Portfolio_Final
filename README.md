CONCEPT
This application was designed for the purpose of providing a unique, one-stop application experience where members are able to research and retrieve recipes for their favorite drinks, learn about the history of spirits, add/update their own recipes to our database, and review testimonials. With most bars and pubs closed due to the pandemic, this application gives the user the opportunity to become their own home bartender.
