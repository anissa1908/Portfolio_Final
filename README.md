# Portfolio_Final

## Concept
This website highlights my accomplishments as a new graduate of UCLA's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp where I learned many programming languages and back-end technologies. It was in this program that I discovered my passion for clean UI designs and innovative concepts as portrayed on the projects I highlight in the Portfolio. My group and I will be presenting "Express Bartender" at the upcoming Demo Day on Nov. 4, 2020.
